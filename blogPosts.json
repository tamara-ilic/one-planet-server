[{"blogTitle":"10 great sustainable gifts for any budget","blogText":"Want to give someone a token of your appreciation without feeling like you’re contributing to unnecessary waste? Tired of buying gifts that ultimately end up in a dark cupboard somewhere or get trashed? Whether it’s for your best friend, your lover, your colleague, grandmother or neighbour - we got you. Yes - sustainable gifts are a thing and can be beautiful.\n\nEven if you’re working towards a reduced waste / zero waste lifestyle yourself, it’s easy to get overwhelmed and be tempted to throw your ethics out of the window when buying for someone else. The pressures surrounding some holidays can be a source of anxiety (we’re looking at you, Christmas…) but we’re here to make choosing a meaningful, sustainable and affordable gift that little bit easier.\n\nYOUR TIMEOften the easiest and most cost-effective of all: your time! What better way to show someone you care about them than to spend time with them? We know this can feel impossible for a lot of people with everything that’s going on in the world right now, but spending time virtually can also make you feel connected. \nWhy not set aside an hour or two for some video call fun and games with someone you miss? Choose a dress-up theme, grab a beverage and kick back! In-person interaction is usually best but your mental health will also greatly benefit from virtual connections.\n\nPERSONALISED COLLAGEMaking collages can be SO much fun AND really meaningful - no two collages will ever be the same. What’s more, if your current situations allow, it’s something you can easily do together. Make use of photos, magazines and newspapers you already have lying around - no need to buy anything special.If you’re in Berlin, make sure you check out our friends  - they host regular collage art workshops in a relaxed and fun environment. Not in Berlin? Check them out for inspiration anyway! This is one of our favourites, created during their ‘Nature and Escapes’ themed workshop:ECO FRIENDLY SHAVING KITEasily our favourite alternative to plastic to date. The perfect sustainable gift for women, men and anyone in-between.Treat someone at the same time as treating the planet. The safety razor is really long-lasting and the blades easy to replace (simply twist the bottom to open) - not to mention really cheap compared to disposable alternatives. Help someone reduce their waste and save money in the long run. Their skin will feel aaaaamazing for it too.Included in the kit: safety razor, replacement razor blades, vegan shaving brush, shaving soap (handmade and can be used on the entire body), an eco soap dish and a natural linen pouch. The kit comes in a box made from domestic grass and waste paper which can be composted.  Not sure they need the whole kit? That’s cool too - why not start them off with just the razor? The One Planet razor comes with a natural linen pouch that is perfect for storage and travelling, as well as a pack of razor blades to get going straight away. HANGING PLANTERSA beautiful addition to any home or office. Really easy to hang and the geometric design allows airflow from all sides. We love these stainless steel ones from Mkouo - they are durable and have no sharp edges. Top tip: clean them with a bit of lemon juice before the first use. \n\nPlants are known to enhance mental and emotional health - especially important during these often disconnected times. REUSABLE COTTON PADS Washable makeup remover pads are the perfect alternative to disposable cotton pads. It pains us to admit that we used 2-3 disposable cotton pads per day before switching...which equates to a terrifying 1,000+ pads thrown away per year 😱 .  And that’s for one person.By making it possible for someone to switch to these reusable facial cleanser pads you will be saving them money AND reducing their waste. They are easy to wash (cotton mesh bag for storage and washing included) and can be used over and over. They can also be repurposed as nursing pads. Always shipped in 100% plastic-free packaging.SOLAR POWERED GLASS JARSA glass jar powered by solar energy….say whaaaaaat? The glass stores energy during the day using a solar panel and releases light at night - producing a stunning result 😍 . A great way to repurpose glass jars you have lying around at home.We found  for making it yourself if you’re up for it. You can personalise it for that special someone if you’re feeling creative.
