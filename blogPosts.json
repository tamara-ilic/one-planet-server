[{"blogTitle":"10 great sustainable gifts for any budget","blogText":["Want to give someone a token of your appreciation without feeling like you’re contributing to unnecessary waste? Tired of buying gifts that ultimately end up in a dark cupboard somewhere or get trashed? Whether it’s for your best friend, your lover, your colleague, grandmother or neighbour - we got you. Yes - sustainable gifts are a thing and can be beautiful.\n","\nEven if you’re working towards a reduced waste / zero waste lifestyle yourself, it’s easy to get overwhelmed and be tempted to throw your ethics out of the window when buying for someone else. The pressures surrounding some holidays can be a source of anxiety (we’re looking at you, Christmas…) but we’re here to make choosing a meaningful, sustainable and affordable gift that little bit easier.","\n\nYOUR TIME","","Often the easiest and most cost-effective of all: your time! What better way to show someone you care about them than to spend time with them? We know this can feel impossible for a lot of people with everything that’s going on in the world right now, but spending time virtually can also make you feel connected. \nWhy not set aside an hour or two for some video call fun and games with someone you miss? Choose a dress-up theme, grab a beverage and kick back! In-person interaction is usually best but your mental health will also greatly benefit from virtual connections.\n\n","PERSONALISED COLLAGE","","Making collages can be SO much fun AND really meaningful - no two collages will ever be the same. What’s more, if your current situations allow, it’s something you can easily do together. Make use of photos, magazines and newspapers you already have lying around - no need to buy anything special.","If you’re in Berlin, make sure you check out our friends  - they host regular collage art workshops in a relaxed and fun environment. Not in Berlin? Check them out for inspiration anyway! This is one of our favourites, created during their ‘Nature and Escapes’ themed workshop:","","","ECO FRIENDLY SHAVING KIT","","Easily our favourite alternative to plastic to date. The perfect sustainable gift for women, men and anyone in-between.","","","Treat someone at the same time as treating the planet. The safety razor is really long-lasting and the blades easy to replace (simply twist the bottom to open) - not to mention really cheap compared to disposable alternatives. Help someone reduce their waste and save money in the long run. Their skin will feel aaaaamazing for it too.","Included in the kit: safety razor, replacement razor blades, vegan shaving brush, shaving soap (handmade and can be used on the entire body), an eco soap dish and a natural linen pouch. The kit comes in a box made from domestic grass and waste paper which can be composted.  ","","Not sure they need the whole kit? That’s cool too - why not start them off with just the razor? The One Planet razor comes with a natural linen pouch that is perfect for storage and travelling, as well as a pack of razor blades to get going straight away. ","","","","HANGING PLANTERS","","A beautiful addition to any home or office. Really easy to hang and the geometric design allows airflow from all sides. ","","","We love these stainless steel ones from Mkouo - they are durable and have no sharp edges. Top tip: clean them with a bit of lemon juice before the first use. \n\n","Plants are known to enhance mental and emotional health - especially important during these often disconnected times. ","","REUSABLE COTTON PADS ","","Washable makeup remover pads are the perfect alternative to disposable cotton pads. It pains us to admit that we used 2-3 disposable cotton pads per day before switching...which equates to a terrifying 1,000+ pads thrown away per year 😱 .  And that’s for one person.","","","By making it possible for someone to switch to these reusable facial cleanser pads you will be saving them money AND reducing their waste. They are easy to wash (cotton mesh bag for storage and washing included) and can be used over and over. They can also be repurposed as nursing pads. Always shipped in 100% plastic-free packaging.","","SOLAR POWERED GLASS JARS","","A glass jar powered by solar energy….say whaaaaaat? The glass stores energy during the day using a solar panel and releases light at night - producing a stunning result 😍 . A great way to repurpose glass jars you have lying around at home.","","","We found  for making it yourself if you’re up for it. You can personalise it for that special someone if you’re feeling creative. ","Don't have the time to make it yourself? SONNENGLAS have you covered. SONNENGLAS was developed in South Africa for people in areas without electricity. Their jars are all handmade and their production has provided much-needed jobs for women and men in Alexandra and Soweto.","","We're not affiliated in any way, just fans","","CORK YOGA MAT","","Looking for a gift for someone whose yoga mat has come to the end of its life? Or are you hoping to make it more comfortable for someone to do strength training, Pilates, stretching or meditation? Whatever the reason or occasion, a mat made from sustainable and ecological materials can be the ideal gift. ","","","We love this non slip yoga mat. The cork surface absorbs excess moisture when sweating and the mat is extra thick to provide comfort.","","","DIY BATH BOMBS","Much easier to make than you might think! Give the gift of relaxation 💆","","Image by Mathilde Langevin via Unsplash.com","","Here is a simple recipe that you can make together or make it yourself and gift it in a repurposed glass jar or old box.","Ingredients ",""," ","Method","","The bath balls will fizz for a few minutes when dropped in the bath.","","WOODEN TOY PUZZLE","","How cute is this?! A handmade wooden helicopter puzzle to inspire creativity in children and improve hand-eye coordination.","","","Choose from a wide variety of animals and vehicles, all are made from light wood and are safe for children. Recommended from 3 years old and above, definitely one parents would enjoy getting involved in too.","RECYCLED NOTEBOOK (FROM ELEPHANT POOP)","","","","This notebook is made from 75% elephant dung and 25% recycled paper! Made by a Sri Lankan charity that cares for elephants and resolves conflict within local communities, it would make an ideal gift for an animal lover, writing lover or just about anyone that appreciates beautiful ethical stationery. The paper is acid free and ecologically safe.","HEADSPACE SUBSCRIPTION","","We're big on mental wellbeing and firmly believe in the importance of looking after one’s mind. What better way to show someone you care about them than inspiring them to take a time-out for themselves on a regular basis? Headspace can help with sleeping problems, stress, anxiety, mindfulness...you name it.","","","","Not sure whether you can nudge them into committing? No problem - simply suggest they try the basic version for free. If they like it, upgrade them to a plan with more features and content (less than €60 per year if paying annually). It will be worth it.","The eagle-eyed amongst you will no-doubt have noticed that there are actually 11 great gift ideas, not 10. Just call that a little gift from us and don't say we've never given you anything... 😉","Seriously though, whatever you decide to make or buy for someone, try not to stress yourself out over it. The main thing is that you put thought into it and gave it from the heart - everything else will take care of itself. ","Let us know in the comments below how you get on or if you have any other eco friendly gift ideas! ","Sending you positive vibes from Berlin and Pula,"," Team One Planet x"],"slug":"10-great-sustainable-gifts-for-any-budget"}]
